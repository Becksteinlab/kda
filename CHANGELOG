  * v0.2.0

  Testing

  * Add test `test_color_by_target` to check flux diagrams are appropriately
    assigning target nodes. Also checks if `_get_node_colors()` is returning
    the correct colors for each flux diagram (PR #66)
  * Add 8-state model test case to `test_flux_diagram_counts()` (PR #60)
  * Add test `test_flux_diagram_counts` which checks the cycle and flux
    diagram counts for several models with known flux diagram counts (PR #59)

  Changes

  * Change `_get_node_labels()` to return integers for all cases (PR #66)
  * Improve performance of `_find_unique_edges()` (PR #60)
  * Simplify `_find_unique_uncommon_edges()` and change call
    signature such that it takes a graph object and the list
    of forward and reverse cycle edges (PR #60)
  * Add functions `_collect_sources()` and `_get_directional_path_edges()`
    to handle the spanning tree pathway finding for
    `generate_directional_diagrams()` (PR #60)
  * Change `generate_directional_diagrams()` to use diagram objects
    to generate directional diagrams, and switch to the NetworkX 
    path finding function `all_simple_edge_paths()` (PR #60)
  * Improve performance of `generate_flux_diagrams()` via various algorithm
    and code simplifications (PR #60)

  * v0.1.0 pre-release

  Initial pre-release. Generates partial, directional and flux diagrams along
  with their respective algebraic expressions.
