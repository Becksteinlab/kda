Note: This method assumes you have an N state diagram already mapped out in
      NetworkX that has all of the rate constants properly associated with
      each process they pertain to.

Diagram Method:
--------------
 1.) Generate the partial diagrams for G:
      i.) Remove one pair of edges from the diagram.
      ii.) Generate a new graph of G minus the edge that was removed.
      iii.) Iterate over all pairs of edges until a new graph has been made
            (and stored) for every possible edge-pair removal.
 2.) Generate the directional partial diagrams:
      i.) Remove original directions from edges.
      ii.) For a given state, iterate over all partial diagrams assigning
           directions to the edges that lead to the state of interest (and
           store these new directional partial diagrams).
      iii.) Repeat for every state in the diagram G.
 3.) Calculate the state probabilities:
      i.) For a given state and directional partial diagram, read the rate
          constant associated with every process that has a direction
          associated with it and multiply these values together.
      ii.) For the same given state, sum all of the directional partial
           diagram terms generated from i.) to obtain the multiplicity of
           that given state.
      iii.) Repeat for every state in G.
      iv.) Sum all state multiplicities to obtain the normalization factor for
           the state probabilities.
 4.) Assign probability values to state nodes in G.
 5.) Generate diagrams of all possible cycles:
 6.) Calculate cycle fluxes for every cycle:
