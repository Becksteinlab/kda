Antiporter Model

Parameters:
 - Binding rate (on rate/association rate constant)
 - Unbinding rate (off rate/dissociation rate constant)
 - Conformational change rate
 - Initial proton concentration inside and outside of cell: pH = 7.2 => C = 1e-7.2
 - Initial ion (i.e. sodium) concentration inside and outside of cell: ~1e-3 M
 - State concentrations: 
 - Turnover number: on the order of 1e2 to 1e4 depending on the transporter
 - Intracellular volume: on the order of 1e-18 m^3
 - Transporter density inside of cell membrane
 - Arrhenius equation (would replace necessity of on rate):
    o Collision frequency at a given temperature
    o Activation energy at a given temperature
